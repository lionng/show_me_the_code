In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.
When the whole world is about to rain, let’s make it clear in our heart together.
If we can only encounter each other rather than stay with each other,then I wish we had never encountered.
I would like weeping with the smile rather than repenting with the cry,when my heart is broken ,is it needed to fix?
No one indebted for others,while many people don't know how to cherish others.
You will have it if it belongs to you,whereas you don't kvetch for it if it doesn't appear in your life.
When a cigarette falls in love with a match,it is destined to be hurt.
No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won’t make you cry.
If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden.
Within you I lose myself, without you I find myself wanting to be lost again.
